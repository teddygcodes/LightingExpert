# Atlantis KB Lighting Expert

A production-grade commercial lighting specification platform built for outside sales engineers and lighting specifiers. Crawls six manufacturer catalogs, normalizes product data through a two-pass extraction pipeline (regex + Claude AI fallback), runs a rule-based cross-reference engine across manufacturers, and generates professional PDF submittal packages — all accessible through a streaming AI chat interface or direct web UI.

---

## What It Does

Commercial lighting specification involves three core workflows that this system automates:

1. **Spec a fixture** — Search across 6 manufacturers by catalog number, fixture type, wattage, lumens, CCT, CRI, voltage, DLC status, or any combination. Every extracted spec carries provenance metadata (source, confidence, raw value) so you know exactly where each number came from.

2. **Cross-reference alternatives** — Given a source fixture, the engine finds compatible substitutes across all manufacturers. Eight hard-reject rules eliminate impossible matches, nine weighted scoring factors rank what remains, and an optional AI post-filter catches edge cases. Results are classified as Direct Replacement, Functional Equivalent, Upgrade, Similar, or Budget Alternative.

3. **Generate submittals** — Assemble professional PDF packages with a branded cover sheet, landscape fixture schedule, and embedded manufacturer spec sheets. Per-item catalog number overrides via the ordering matrix configurator. Missing or corrupt spec sheets get clean placeholder pages.

All three workflows are available through a **Claude Sonnet chat agent** with five integrated tools (search, cross-reference, spec sheet lookup, submittal addition, fixture recommendation), or through dedicated UI pages.

Crawlers and extraction scripts are standalone `ts-node` processes — not API routes. Playwright requires a full Chromium instance, and these pipelines can run for hours against large catalogs. They execute manually or via cron on a machine with Node and Chromium installed.

## Data Model

Eight models, seven enums. Core relationships:

```
Manufacturer ──< Category (hierarchical tree per manufacturer)
Manufacturer ──< Product (50+ fields, fieldProvenance JSON per field)
Manufacturer ──< OrderingMatrix (configurable / SKU table / hybrid)
Manufacturer ──< CrawlLog (audit trail per crawl run)

Product ──< CrossReference (source) ──> Product (target)
Product ──< SubmittalItem ──> Submittal
Product ──> OrderingMatrix (optional, for part number configuration)

Chat ──> ChatProject (optional grouping)
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Field provenance.** Every extracted value on a `Product` records its `source` (REGEX, AI_FALLBACK, MANUAL), `confidence` (0–1), and `rawValue`. MANUAL fields are never overwritten by crawls. The UI surfaces confidence indicators so specifiers can judge data quality at a glance.

**Two-pass extraction.** Regex runs first — fast, deterministic, free. AI fallback fires only when overall confidence drops below threshold. This keeps API costs proportional to catalog complexity, not catalog size. On AI failure, confidence scores are degraded rather than silently preserved.

**Staged spec promotion.** Raw PDF text and AI outputs land in staging columns (`rawSpecText`, `specExtractionJson`). A separate `promote-specs` script validates and writes them to live product columns. A bad extraction run never clobbers production data.

**Range columns.** Many fixtures ship in wattage-selectable or lumen-selectable configurations. The schema carries both nominal values (`wattage`, `lumens`) and range columns (`wattageMin/Max`, `lumensMin/Max`) so the cross-reference engine can do range-overlap scoring instead of brittle point comparisons.

**Hard rejects before scoring.** The cross-reference engine applies binary pass/fail rules (voltage, mounting, environment, CCT, form factor) before computing weighted scores. This prevents wasting compute on obviously incompatible fixtures and keeps the scored result set meaningful.

---

## Cross-Reference Engine

The engine (`lib/cross-reference.ts`) is fully rule-based — no vector similarity.

### Category Pre-Filtering

The source fixture's **fixture group** (HIGH_BAY, TROFFER_PANEL, DOWNLIGHT, WALL_PACK, etc.) is determined from its category path. Candidates are built in three passes:

1. **Group pass** — same fixture group only. If >= 5 candidates, stop.
2. **Branch pass** — relax to same root category branch. If >= 5, stop.
3. **All pass** — no detectable category; fall back to all active products.

A high bay cross-reference will never surface a troffer or downlight.

### Hard Reject Rules

| Rule | Logic |
|---|---|
| Environment mismatch | INDOOR vs OUTDOOR (BOTH bypasses) |
| Emergency backup | Source requires it; target does not |
| Voltage incompatible | Mismatched voltages (UNIVERSAL and V120_277 bypass) |
| Mounting incompatible | No overlapping mounting types |
| CCT incompatible | Zero CCT overlap when source has 2+ defined options |
| Form factor | Incompatible sizes (2x4 vs 2x2, 4" vs 6") |
| Category mismatch | Different fixture groups (redundant safety net) |

### Scoring Factors (9 weighted, sum = 1.0)

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Form factor match | 0.20 |
| Lumens range overlap | 0.20 |
| CRI match | 0.10 |
| CCT options overlap | 0.10 |
| Dimming protocol | 0.10 |
| DLC listing | 0.10 |
| IP/NEMA rating | 0.10 |
| Wattage overlap | 0.05 |
| Physical dimensions | 0.05 |

Soft penalties (not hard rejects): wet location downgrade (-0.05), NEMA rating downgrade (-0.04).

### Match Classification

| Score | Type |
|---|---|
| >= 0.90 | DIRECT_REPLACEMENT |
| >= 0.75 | FUNCTIONAL_EQUIVALENT |
| >= 0.60 | UPGRADE (if target lumens > source x 1.1) or SIMILAR |
| < 0.60 | BUDGET_ALTERNATIVE |

## Chat Agent

Claude Sonnet with five tools, streamed via Vercel AI SDK:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_products` | Full-text + structured filter search (query, manufacturer, category, lumen/wattage ranges, CCT, CRI, environment, DLC, wet location) |
| `cross_reference` | Runs the matching engine against a catalog number |
| `get_spec_sheet` | Returns cached spec sheet PDF path for inline rendering |
| `add_to_submittal` | Adds a fixture to the most recent DRAFT submittal |
| `recommend_fixtures` | Given a fixture class and project context, returns ranked candidates |

The agent always calls `search_products` before `cross_reference` — it never guesses catalog numbers. Chat history persists to PostgreSQL with debounced saves. Conversations are trimmed at 20 messages; tool results older than position 10 are stripped to manage token count. Rate limited at 20 requests/IP/minute.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Claude API key (chat, extraction, cross-ref filter) |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | No | Enables Clerk authentication |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | No | Clerk frontend key |

## Security

- **SQL injection**: All queries parameterized via Prisma template literals. Search input length-capped at 200 characters.
- **Path traversal**: Spec sheet paths resolved with `path.resolve()` and validated against the `public/` boundary.
- **Auth**: Admin routes protected with `requireAuth()`. Auth bypassed with logged warning when Clerk env vars unset.
- **Internal field stripping**: `rawSpecText`, `specExtractionJson`, `specEvidenceJson`, `crawlEvidence` stripped from all API responses.
- **Security headers**: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy` applied globally.
- **Rate limiting**: IP-based, 20 req/min on chat endpoint. In-memory with 60s cleanup.
- **Request guards**: Messages array capped at 100/request. Pagination capped at 100 results/page. String fields length-validated.
- **Error handling**: Server-side logging with generic client responses. No stack traces or Prisma errors exposed. Global error boundary with error digest IDs.

---

## Full-Text Search

The `searchVector` column is `Unsupported("tsvector")` in the Prisma schema — Prisma does not create or manage it. It is populated by a `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger. The same migration enables `pg_trgm` for typo-tolerant fuzzy fallback.

If search returns no results after a schema migration, the trigger was dropped:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < prisma/migrations/001_search_vector_trigger.sql
```

---

## Roadmap

| Version | Feature |
|---|---|
| v2 | Clerk authentication, multi-tenant projects, client-facing submittal portal |
| v2 | Redis-backed rate limiting, strict CSP, CSRF tokens |
| v2.5 | pgvector embeddings for semantic product similarity search |
| v3 | Migration under `/lighting/` in the `atlantiskb-home` monorepo |
